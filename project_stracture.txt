# Reconciliation System Prototype

This repository demonstrates a prototype for a reconciliation system, showcasing skills in Python, data processing, and system design. The project is structured to handle data matching, preprocessing, and reporting, with a modular approach to support future enhancements.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Stores input and output data, including reports, processed files, and training datasets.
- `frontend/`: Contains scripts for the user interface (e.g., `frontend.py`).
- `src/`: Houses the core Python scripts, including:
  - `main.py`: Orchestrates the workflow.
  - `preprocess.py`: Prepares data for analysis.
  - `deposits_matcher.py` & `withdrawals_matcher.py`: Implement matching logic.
  - `reports_creator.py`: Generates summary reports.
  - `trackers_update.py`: Updates tracking mechanisms.
  - `utils.py`: Provides reusable functions.
  - `config.py`: Manages configuration settings.
- `tests/`: Includes unit tests and sample data for validation.
- `venv/`: Virtual environment for dependencies.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming and modular design.
- Data preprocessing and ETL processes.
- Basic data matching and reporting workflows.

## Usage
This is a portfolio showcase. For detailed implementation, please contact the author. Do not reuse code without permission (MIT License applies).
